# Stock Price Prediction
This was part of my Pre-College Summer Immersion Program at Columbia University where I studied various Machine Learning algorithms including Linear and Logistical Regression, and gained familiarity 
with statistical frameworks and methods designed to extract practical insights from data. I applied the learnings to create a program for predicting stock prices in the New York Stock Exchange.
